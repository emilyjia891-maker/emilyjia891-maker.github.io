I obtained my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Arts and Social Sciences from Maastricht University, the Netherlands, in September 2025. I also hold a Master of Arts degree in English Language, Literature and Culture from Beijing International Studies University, China (2017–2020). In addition, I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English (2012-2016) and a Bachelor of Management degree with a minor in Marketing from Anhui Polytechnic University, China (2013–2016).
